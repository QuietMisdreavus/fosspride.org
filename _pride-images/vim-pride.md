Have you ever wanted your text editor to be a little more queer?

This image set features the classic Vim logo, in a combination of LGBTQ+ pride flags.

Vim is created and maintained by Bran Moolenaar. It and its logo are available under a [charityware]
license.

[charityware]: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/uganda.html

The full archive contains high-resolution images for each pride flag icon, as well as the GIMP
source file used to create them.

These designs, like all the FOSS Pride icons, can be bought as stickers, t-shirts, or many other
items in our [online store]({{ site.data.settings.store_link }})!
