title: About this collection
---

In the summer of 2020, as QuietMisdreavus was unemployed and self-quarantined during the COVID-19
pandemic, she decided to try her hand at modifying graphics. Inspired by the trans-flag Vim sticker
on her laptop, she decided to recreate that as well as several other variants using other LGBTQ+
pride flags. From there the idea spread to other icons, and this site was born to host them all.

Each software project in this collection has a "source files" archive that contains high-resolution
versions of the logos, as well as the GIMP project file used to create the images. The full list can
be accessed using the "Pride Images" link in the top menu. The files are distributed under the same
license as their source icon.

If you would like to support the project, feel free to purchase stickers or apparel from the [online
store]!
