Today i posted an update to the FOSS Pride icon packs, adding new variants with the Asexual,
Bisexual, and Pansexual pride flags!

Adding additional flags was a very early request when i got started with FOSS Pride, so i'm happy to
expand the roster. I hope you enjoy! Let me know if you have a request for another flag that would
lend itself well to this kind of treatment.
